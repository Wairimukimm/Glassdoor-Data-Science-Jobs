# GLASSDOOR JOB ANALYSIS

This project invloves data cleaning and explaratory data analysis to get meaningful insights from the data.
## BUSINESS AND DATA UNDERSTANDING

Glassdoor is a popular online platform where employees and former employees anonymously review companies and their management. The platform also provides job listings, salary data, and interview insights, creating a rich dataset covering various aspects of the job market. This project aims to tap into this wealth of information to gain valuable insights into job trends, company reputations, and compensation patterns.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Glassdoor Data Science Project aims to derive actionable insights and provide valuable information to job seekers and employers using the extensive dataset available on Glassdoor. The project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to analyze and uncover patterns within job postings, company reviews, and salary information to help users make informed decisions related to their career choices.


## COMPONENTS

* The Jupyter Notebook is the main deliverable. It contains the details of the approach taken and the methodology. It contains data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data preparation for modelling and building the classification models.

## DATA WRANGLING

In this section, I did data preparation which invloved:

Checking for missing values, removing duplicates, renaming columns and dropping unnecessary columns to ensure the data is clean and suitable for analysis and modelling.
## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

I perfomed both univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns in the dataset.

Customers who complain have a very high chance of churning.
Females are more likely to churn than men
Customers with few products are more likely to churn
## MODELS
